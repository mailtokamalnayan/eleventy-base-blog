The development of agriculture was the most historical event for me. Even more fascinating was that it was developed independently all over the world. 

Agriculture, in turn, had multiple multi-order effects on our civilization. We started with people needing land protection, leading to kingdoms, military, and whatnot. 

Homo sapiens started relying most on gods, which led to the development of religion. Religion existed before agriculture, which only strengthened its need further.
