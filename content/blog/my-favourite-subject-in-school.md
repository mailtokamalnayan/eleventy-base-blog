Mathematics was my least favorite. Followed by biology and chemistry. Didnâ€™t care much for physics either.

Social studies that included geography and history was my favorite. I used to daydream about the places mentioned in geography and history. I distinctly remember reading about red soil and thinking about how it would be to see it in person. I finally saw it in person, after nearly 15 years of reading about it and was elated.

Same for history. I love to see those places mentioned in the books where significant historical events took place. Visiting Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar sent shivers down my spine. One of the places on my wishlist is to see the spot related to [**Kakori Train Action**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakori_conspiracy). No proper reason. Just a childhood dream to see the place where something like this happened a hundred years ago. I am not so keen on world history though. I am yet to develop an interest in world history.
