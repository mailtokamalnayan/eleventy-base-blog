When food, shelter, and clothes are taken care of, it is very easy to get hung up on trivial things. While taking the every **next** leap, the previous leap becomes our base or so-called the “basic.” So how do we learn the skill of getting the goalpost to stop moving?

I think it mostly depends on the kind of people we surround ourselves with. And it’s not just in real life but also on social media. It is inevitable to compare ourselves with people around us. And as usual, social media has made it worse. People don’t really communicate on social media so much as they perform for one another. We are bound to compare ourselves with peers through a curated highlight reel of their lives where positives are embellished, and negatives are hidden.

So the cure is to either find genuine people that share the same priorities (archtypes of who we want to be) or always keep reminding that what we see is not the whole truth.

A deep introspection to what we really need and define what’s enough might also do the job of keeping the goalpost constant.
