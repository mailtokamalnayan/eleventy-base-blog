title: Japan is personal

Japan is deeply personal. But it has nothing to do with you. When you visit this country, you might counter numerous examples of this. Starting from a lady from a tiny patisserie flashes you a beautiful smile and spends inordinate amount of time placing your mochi balls (that doesn't cost more than a $, mind you) in an immaculately designed box. And then she encloses it with a bag of ice so that the pastry won't melt on the long way home. Then she wraps the box in a seasonal paper and appends a bow under a badge to keep it shut.

When you visit a coffee shop for a pour over coffee, the man in a bow tie, dressed as well as you did on your marriage washes your up and saucer in a warm water so that when he pours your coffee in it, it doesn't make a difference.

In Japan, you are always in the realm of transpersonal. Everything is deeply personal but it has nothing to do with you.
