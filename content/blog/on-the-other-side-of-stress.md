Apparently, most of the modern-day advancement has come from the time of adversity. And from the entity that’s perpetually in the state of fighting adversity – the armed forces. 

Radar, microprocessors, Internet, antibiotics, GPS, and microwave ovens, to name a few. The innovation team at the Army is in a constant state of fear, and that continues to drive their innovation in ways a team at Silicon Valley engineers can’t. The incentives of Silicon Valley engineers lie in their belief that if they can’t figure something out, they might lose the hike or, in the worst case, the job. For the people in the armed forces, if they can’t figure it out, they’ll die. And perhaps a whole lot of other people might die as well. 

World War II began on horses in 1939 and ended with the development of Nuclear Fission in 1945. All within six years.

The 1930s were a disaster for the USA but, in retrospect, did amazing things for the coming decades. It was the most productive and technologically progressive decade in the history of the USA. Electrification, along with transportation, surged in the same decade. The reason is that people were traumatized by the Great Depression, so that fear increased the pace of innovation.

It’s difficult to imagine the upsides as a crisis is happening, but upsides indeed occur. The cliched saying, “Every cloud has a silver lining,” is cliched for a reason – it’s true.
