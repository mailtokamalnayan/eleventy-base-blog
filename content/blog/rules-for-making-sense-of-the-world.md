**Need for certainty is the greatest disease of mind.** We all crave for certainty because it calms us down. Gives us hope. But world works in weird and inexplicable ways. One of the [Nobel Prize winners in mathematic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash_Jr.)s also believed that aliens were recruiting him. Embrace those uncertainty and include those unknowns in the calculations. 

**What’s rational to us can be crazy to someone else**. Our experience shape us and our views about the world. Everyone has different experiences of the world. Heck, even the same experience can be processed differently by two individuals. Factor these differences in goals, ambitions and risk tolerances when something doesn’t align with our own. People *are* built different. 

**Incentives work wonders (or disasters).** Everything works on incentive. Always try to look for incentives that people are motivated by and whether they will work for you or against. Like a fixed fee investment advisor or a commission based investment advisor. For the later, their incentives are more inclined towards selling products that can earn them commissions which may or may not align with your goals. 

**Stories sell more than statistics. **Power of stories is apparent. If you want to have an impact, tell them a story about your statistics instead of just handing the statistics. Equally important is to know when you’re getting influenced by stories (it’s easier than we think) or statistics.
