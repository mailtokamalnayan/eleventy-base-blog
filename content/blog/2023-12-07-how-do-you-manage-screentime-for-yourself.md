I’ve been on and off the wagon on managing screentime for me for the last 5 years or so, especially after the fact that these websites have become so addictive in nature. When I think back at **those** simpler times, most of our time was spent either in chatrooms or in the forums. There wasn’t much social credit to be earned, so things were simpler.

In the last few years, I’ve tried [**Freedom**](https://freedom.to/). It worked until it worked and then it stopped working, and I guess I have now almost forgotten about it.

Then I tried [**One sec.**](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/one-sec-screen-time-focus/id1532875441) It appeared as clever, and it worked like a charm as well. It brought some intentionality, but then, in a couple of weeks, I became so overwhelmed with self-loathing that I ended up deleting it and going back to using Twitter and Instagram like I used to before – just before going to bed and right after waking up.

Sooner or later, I want to pick up maybe [***Digital Minimalism***](https://www.amazon.in/Digital-Minimalism-Choosing-Focused-Noisy/dp/0525536515) book and get something sustainable from it. Till then, I am just relying on “motivation” and constant self-reminder to manage screen time.

I would love to know how you manage it for yourself. Reply to me on Twitter – [**@kns008**](https://twitter.com/kns008).
