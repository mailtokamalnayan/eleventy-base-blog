When I was in school, I had the opportunity to meet multiple politicians at once who had come to inaugurate my school. It was the first of its-kind school in the entire state, so there were many delegates who made their presence at the time of innaguration.

Lalu Prasad Yadav was among one of them. He was ousted as the chief minister of Bihar because he was part of a recent scam, so his wife assumed the responsibility. Apparently, his wife didn’t know how to read or write, so he was still ruling the state unofficially.

In his time, he was a charming orator who managed to keep the crowd entertained. People liked him and they voted for him, term after term. Other delegates in that group included the then Defence Minister of India as well, but I am not sure if he could be considered more famous than Lalu Prasad Yadav.
