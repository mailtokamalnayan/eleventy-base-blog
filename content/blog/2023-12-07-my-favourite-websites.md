It’s not an easy question to answer, but let's try my favorite websites recently apart from the usual suspects, Twitter and Instagram. 

**Reddit** is my absolute favorite because of the way it’s built. People are anonymous (almost), so there's no social currency. It’s just pure spitting of facts. Sometimes, people aren’t forgiving enough, but I'll take that tradeoff for honesty. If I'm in the market for something, I'll start by reading Reddit reviews. 

**Hacker News** is another exciting place where I passively consume content. The signal-to-noise ratio is very high, and if I could just read the top three posts (articles), I'd be brighter than ever before. 

**Team-BHP** is yet another user-created content website I love spending time on. Reading other people's views on cars is exciting to me at this juncture. Somewhat like Reddit, and unlike Twitter and Instagram, there's not much social credit to be earned, so people are honest (sometimes biased). Did I mention earnestly helpful, too, if you needed a query answered?

**Mobbin** is a treasure trove of actual design inspiration from live apps. Before starting work, I go through it for a few minutes to get inspired. Sometimes, I refer to it when designing something from scratch, and I'm stuck because reinventing the wheel is the last thing I want to do. 

**YouTube** is everyone's favorite, but their recommendation engine has recommended channels with less than 1K subscribers, and it was exactly what I was looking for. Somehow, those channels also turn out to be consistent in putting their content, so subscribing pays off. I've seen a few channels grow from 25K subscriptions to 1M. 

Other notable mention includes **The Economist**, but I sometimes feel so disconnected from what's happening in the world that I end up not opening it for months. **Finshots** is very interesting and approachable because the content is Indian-focused (mostly). Their stories are also easily digestible.
