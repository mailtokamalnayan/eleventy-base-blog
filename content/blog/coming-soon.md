[**1000 true fans**](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/) — the idea was so simple that it resonated with me in the first read itself. Then, with every year, it resonated even more because I got to know the potential of the web. At best, all you need is just 1000 true fans for your work, and that's good enough to lead a decent life. It's not an overnight thing where you go viral and have many subscribers. The essence is on the word – *true fans*. They build over time. Maybe a few years because they're built on trust. And, like every other good thing out there, it takes time. According to Kevin Kelly, *true* fans will buy anything you produce. 

[**Learning to see** ](https://ia.net/topics/category/design)— my main takeaway from this article was knowing what's worth arguing about and what's not when defending design decisions. 

- Whether someone likes pink or not is just personal taste, and you can't argue. You can't say whether they like black coffee or white coffee. It's just personal preference. 
- However, whether to keep the line height of a paragraph 150% is purely a technical decision, and you *can* argue about it because it affects readability. 
- Based on the font and context, whether the line height should be 145% is pure sophistication and comes with just practice and developing that eye for sophistication.
