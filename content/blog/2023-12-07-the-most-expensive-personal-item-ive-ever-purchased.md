If we remove the home and car (neither of which I own), then the next most expensive purchase would definitely be my Leica Q2. It’s not surprising that before the Q2, the most expensive purchase by me was still the Leica Q.

Personally, I think I paid a bit too much for both of these cameras, but the amount of joy per click they have given me so far sort of justifies it. The best thing about the Leica Q series is the lens, as it should be… in a camera(!). Not the features around it (as is the case with Sony, etc.), but the lens itself. Everything else just revolves around it. When I had gotten the Leica Q, I sold it off after a month. Not because I felt let down by it, but more because I thought the Fujifilm X100F was already 70% there at a fraction of the price. Then the X100V came along, and it was 80% there.

But there remained a 20% hole in my heart for Leica Q. Meanwhile, Leica Q2 launched and took the series even further by adding a buttload of megapixels and weather sealing. Then Leica Q3 came along, which didn’t exactly move the needle as much as Q2 did. Though, a preferable second-order effect was that Leica Q2 became cheaper. Well, *relatively* cheaper.

And I snagged one. Making it the most expensive personal item I’ve ever purchased.
