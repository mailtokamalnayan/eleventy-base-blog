Carl Jung had a theory called enantiodromia, which means an excess of something gives rise to its opposite.

Paranoia leads to success because it keeps you on your toes. But paranoia is stressful, so we get rid of it as soon as we get successful. But now, we have abandoned what made us successful in the first place, so we begin to decline.

When an economy is stable, people get optimistic. When they get confident, they go into debt, and when people go into debt, the economy becomes unstable.

Another pervasive life cycle of greed and fear goes like this:

- First, we assume good news is permanent
- Then we become oblivious to bad news
- Then we ignore bad news
- Then we deny bad news
- Then we panic at bad news
- Then we accept bad news
- Then we assume bad news is permanent
- Then, we become oblivious to the good news
- Then we ignore good news
- Deny good news
- Accept the good news
- Assume good news is permanent
- And we repeat the same cycle again and again.

These cycles are probably the only explanation for why things seem crazy initially, but they aren’t.

So what can be done here? Morgan Housel, in his book Same as Ever, suggests two things:

- The first is accepting that crazy doesn’t mean anything but ordinary. Even beyond the point of crazy is normal. So just be prepared to deal with those black swan events (the starting point is to read Black Swan by Nassim Nicholas Taleb)
- The second is realising the power of enough. Or instead focusing on defining what’s enough. Stop that lifestyle inflation. With every 50K increment in salary, don’t move to a 5K more expensive flat. Define what’s good enough and stick to it. It’s hard knowing that you can afford much more or do more, yet you don’t because you’ve defined what’s enough.

To quote investor Chamath Palihapitiya: “I would really love to just compound at fifteen per cent per year. Because if I can just do that for fifty years, that’s just enormous. Just slow and steady against hard problems.”

The cliched sayings like “Slow and steady wins the race” are cliched for a reason. And the reason is simple – they’re true because they’ve stood the test of time.
